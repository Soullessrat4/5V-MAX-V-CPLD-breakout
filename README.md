The board exposes 48 I/O pins of this CPLD, aims to have acceptable performance at the maximum speeds that this CPLD can support, and convert all logic and power to 5v.

Ideally this makes integration or development with the CPLD very easy in existing 5v systems.

It is licenced under CERN-OHL-P-2.0, meaning that it can be freely used for any purpose or improved upon by anyone without uploading the improvements, although this would be appreciated.
